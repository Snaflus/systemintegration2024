# 04b [Pair] Database granular access

**Type**: Work in pairs. Switch role between exposee and integrator. 

This is a pair-wise project but the hand-in is individual. 

Work in pairs (two and two). Switch role as exposee and integrator. 

The point of creating users that have granular access will make having a REST API redundant. This is integration at a database level. 

## Exposee

Create a page that documents a way to access the data. 
 

## Integrator

Connect to the database and try to manipulate the data. Do also try to write to tables/collections you aren’t allowed to.

If the documentation is insufficient then help your partner by telling them to add the necessary information in the documentation rather than having them only fix it in production. 

You are not allowed to write any code. Connect through a database client. 
 
## Do it again

Switch roles between exposee and integrator. Work independently. Absolutely do not sit together and solve the assignment. Agreeing on a database that both use is not a good sign. 

## Requirements

**Deploy**: The database must be hosted in cloud at some point. No requirement regarding keeping them hosted for the exam. That’s why thorough documentation and screenshots is important to bring to the exam. 

**Granularity**: There must be data that the integrator:

- Cannot read
- Can only read
- Can read and write

There are no requirements regarding choice of database but given the constraint regarding granular access part of the assignment is to research and choose well. The more granular the better! There are wrong choices here. 



**Complete Documentation**: The Exposee's documentation must include all necessary information for integration, such as usernames and passwords. Missing information is an indicator of inadequate documentation.

The Integrator should focus on verifying the Exposee's documentation's effectiveness for integration. Direct assistance or collaboration in solving the assignment is not allowed.

## Granular Access

* **Detailed Permissions**: Specifies precise access levels for different parts of a database.
* **Controlled Access**: Users have access only to necessary data, not the entire database.
* **Enhanced Security**: Limits exposure of sensitive data by restricting user access.
* **Data Integrity**: Reduces risk of unauthorized alterations, maintaining data accuracy.


## Project Timeline and milestones

This is not a task that should be solved within the week. Split up the assignment so that:

- Week 1: Research and select an appropriate database.
- Week 2: Set up the database and start creating the documentation.
- Week 3: Send the documentation to the integrator and change the documentation according to their feedback. Also take the role as integrator for your partner, try to connect and give feedback. 


## For the exam

Exposee: Besides the docs given to the integrator you must also generate docs for the entire database. 
Exposee: It is recommended to create a document where you note down the result of your research containing arguments for and against various databases. 

**Hand-in**: 

There will be two hand-ins:
2. **Exposee**: Documentation 
1. **Integrator**: Screenshots.
