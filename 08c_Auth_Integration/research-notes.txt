AWS Cognito and Azure AD are complex to set up and navigate. Ecosystem based and works best with their own ecosystem.

Google Cloud Identity is easier to set up but also suffers from being heavily ecosystem based (also less mature than previous two)

Okta incredibly robust and wide range of features but this also means it can be complex to set up. Expensive for small business.

Auth0 good documentation and somewhat wide range of features. Expensive at large scale.

I excluded the first 3 purely based on the ecosystem factor
Between Okta and Auth0 I ended up going with Auth0 for the strong documentation
